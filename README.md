## Future Improvements
* Adding more types of spikes or hurdles.
* Adding support for Google Play Games Api.
* Powerups is something that is lacking in this game, which can make it more fun to play. Both positive and negative powerups could be added. Positive ones like decrease speed, destroy spikes on touch, removing half of player for short time, etc. I have only one negative poerup - increase speed.
